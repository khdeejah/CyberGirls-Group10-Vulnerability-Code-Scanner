 **Vulnerability Code Scanner Script**
 
**Overview**

This project contains a Bash script designed to automate the process of scanning source code files or directories for potential security vulnerabilities. It uses The Silver Searcher (ag) to identify patterns that might indicate common security issues and generates detailed reports of any findings.

**Features**

Checks if ag (The Silver Searcher) is installed and prompts for installation if not,
Scans specified source code files or directories for predefined security patterns.
Logs findings with details including issue type, severity, OWASP category, CVE ID, and suggested remediation.
Outputs detailed results to a temporary file and appends them to a log file.
Prerequisites
The Silver Searcher (ag): If not installed, the script will prompt you to install it, based on your system using one of the following package managers:

apt-get (Debian-based systems)

yum (Red Hat-based systems)

brew (macOS)


**Usage**

clone the Repository using the command git clone https://github.com/khdeejah/CyberGirls-Group10-Vulnerability-Code-Scanner.git

make the script executable using the command chmod +x Autoscan.sh

Run the script; ./Autoscan.sh

on entering that command, the code first check to see if the dependency "ag" is installed on the user system and if not, the user is then given a guide on the command to use in installing it based on the system.

once installed, the user gets a prompt to input the path to the source code file or directory they wish to scan.

it will then proceed with the scan and provide detailed result upon completion of the scan.
